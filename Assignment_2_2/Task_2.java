//You have a bad example of using methods in front of you:
//        1. The methods divided the couplets;
//2. One line of code should not be wrapped in a separate method.
//Rewrite the code so that all the text is printed in the main method, and delete the other
//methods. The
//program output should not change.
//        Requirements:
//        • The main() method must be the only method in the Solution class.
//        • The output in the console must match the task condition.
